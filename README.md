# Forms
This is an index of forms that have been identified from a scrape of austintexas.gov spanning five years worth of PDF document from January 1, 2015 to April 1, 2019. Additional dorms, both PDF and paper based, will be uploaded as they are discovered.

## Introduction

- **Departments**: the City of Austin Departments that involved in the provision of service provided by the form
- **Feature**: a specific aspect of the form such as payments or documents
- **Category**: the area with which the service is associated such as Health, Affordability, Permits, etc.
